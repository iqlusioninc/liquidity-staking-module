# ADR-003: Disable Tokenizing Shares

## Context

Currently LSM facilites the immediate conversion of staked assets into liquid staked tokens (process hereinafter referred to as "tokenization"). Despite the many benefits that come with this capability, it does inadvertently negate a protective measure available via traditional staking, where a user can stake their tokens to render them illiquid in the event that their wallet is compromised (the attacker would first need to unbond, then transfer out the tokens). 

LSM would obviate this safety measure, as an attacker could tokenize and immediately transfer staked tokens to another wallet. So, as an additional protective measure, this proposal incorporates a feature to permit users to selectively disable the tokenization of their stake. 

## Proposal
This proposal grants users the ability to disable and reactivate the ability to tokenizate their stake. When tokenization is disabled, a lock is placed on the user's account, effectively preventing the conversion of any of their delegations. Re-enabling tokenization would initiate the removal of the lock, but the process is not immediate. The lock removal is queued, with the lock itself persisting throughout the unbonding period. Following the completion of the unbonding period, the lock would be completely removed, restoring the user's ablility to tokenize. For users who choose to enable the lock, this delay better positions them to regain control of their funds in the event their wallet is compromised.

## Technical Spec

### Additional Data Structures
```proto
// PendingTokenizeShareAuthorizations stores a list of addresses that have their 
// tokenize share re-enablement in progress
message PendingTokenizeShareAuthorizations {
  repeated string addresses = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
}
```

### Transactions
```proto
// Prevents an address from tokenizing any of their delegations
message MsgDisableTokenizeShares {
  string delegator_address = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
}

// EnableTokenizeShares begins the re-allowing of tokenizing shares for an address,
// which will complete after the unbonding period
// The time at which the lock is completely removed is returned in the response
message MsgEnableTokenizeShares {
  string delegator_address = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
}
```

### Queries
```proto
// Queries the status of an account's tokenize share lock (LOCKED, UNLOCKED, or LOCK_EXPIRING)
// as well as the lock expiration time, if applicable
message QueryTokenizeShareLockInfo {
  string address = 1;
}
message QueryTokenizeShareLockInfoResponse{
  string status = 1;
  string expiration_time = 2;
}
```

### Keeper Functions
```go
// Adds a lock that prevents tokenizing shares for an account
// The tokenize share lock store is implemented by keying on the account address
// and storing a timestamp as the value. The timestamp is empty when the lock is
// set and gets populated with the unlock completion time once the unlock has started
func AddTokenizeSharesLock(address sdk.AccAddress) 

// Removes the tokenize share lock for an account to enable tokenizing shares
func RemoveTokenizeSharesLock(address sdk.AccAddress) 

// Updates the timestamp associated with a lock to the time at which the lock expires
func SetTokenizeShareUnlockTime(address sdk.AccAddress, completionTime time.Time) 

// Checks if there is currently a tokenize share lock for a given account
// Returns a bool indicating if the account is locked, as well as the unlock time
// which may be empty if an unlock has not been initiated
func IsTokenizeSharesDisabled(address sdk.AccAddress) (disabled bool, unlockTime time.Time) 

// Stores a list of addresses pending tokenize share unlocking at the same time
func SetPendingTokenizeShareAuthorizations(completionTime time.Time, authorizations types.PendingTokenizeShareAuthorizations)

// Returns a list of addresses pending tokenize share unlocking at the same time
func GetPendingTokenizeShareAuthorizations() PendingTokenizeShareAuthorizations 

// Inserts thea ddress into a queue where it will sit for 1 unbonding period
// before the tokenize share lock is removed
// Returns the completion time
func QueueTokenizeSharesAuthorization(address sdk.AccAddress) time.Time 

// Unlocks all queued tokenize share authorizations that have matured
// (i.e. have waited the full unbonding period)
func RemoveExpiredTokenizeShareLocks(blockTime time.Time) (unlockedAddresses []string) 
```
